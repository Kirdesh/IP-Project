# IP-Project
This is our space race timeline website

 
## Design Process
 
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url. 

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing
1. Quiz Testing:
    1. Play the Quiz
    2. Ensured that the score tallies with the number of questions correctly answered
    3. Ensured that the quiz ends after 10 questions have been given
    4. Ensured that quiz questions are randomised after multiple attempts
    5. Ensured that the score is saved when saving the score
    6. Ensured the leaderboard displays the top 5 scores after doing the quiz multiple times
    


In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
