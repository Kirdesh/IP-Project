# IP-Project
This is our space race timeline website

 
## Design Process

- As a student, I want to learn more about history, so that I can do better in school.
- As a student, I want to test myself, to that I know what I have learnt and what I have not learnt.

When thinking about what website we wanted to create, we wanted to do something different. Thus we decided to do something that has been overlooked by many but it had a huge impact on mankind.
So we thought of the space race. Once we got the theme we decided to do a timeline where it will inform users of what happened and when it happend. and then we decided to add a quiz for the 
gamification portion of the webpage. this will help those users who are studying history or have an interesdt in space travel. they would learn more about it in our website.



This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

## Features
 
### Existing Features

Quiz Section
- Quiz questions stored in a json storage database
- Quiz questions are randomised
- A local storage that stores and displays the Top 5 Scores of users that have completed the quiz

Timeline section
- This allows users who are interested in history or the space race to learn more about the space race, by having them scroll through the timeline
- There are also fun fact sections where there are interesting facts that normal users most likely would not have known and they will also have learnt something


In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Scrolling animation
- There will be a spaceship that follows the scrolling of the person so there will be an animation at all times when the user is reading through the timeline


### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

Interactable objects
- Plans to add more interactable objeect at on the timeline where the user would be able to move objects around

Quiz Section
- Plans to implement simple minigames such as Flappy Bird but with a Space-themed twist

## Technologies Used

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.

- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
    - The project uses **Sass** to get the parallex scrolling effect




## Testing
1. Quiz Testing:
    1. Play the Quiz
    2. Ensured that the score tallies with the number of questions correctly answered
    3. Ensured that the quiz ends after 10 questions have been given
    4. Ensured that quiz questions are randomised after multiple attempts
    5. Ensured that the score is saved when saving the score
    6. Ensured the leaderboard displays the top 5 scores after doing the quiz multiple times

2. Timeline Testing:
    1. Start the webpage
    2. Ensure that the contents are at the right place
    3. Ensure that the 3d model are playing properly
    4. Ensure that the fun fact pops up when hovering over it
    5. Ensure that the page tranistions correctly when clicking a link

    


In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

- The webpage is optimized for desktops and laptops.

- It can also be used on a hand held device however it might be harder to navigate and use the webpage




You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

- During the normal testing from VScode the webpage works fine however when using the github link, the page does not link properly. The timeline link to the quiz does not work.
